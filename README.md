# Text analisys to infer personality
The aim of this study is to understand if personality is a factor determining how a person writes and therefore if it
is possible to detect personality from social media posts. The
proposed methodology is applied on the Myers-Briggs Personality
Type Dataset and involves the employment of the following techniques: building word clouds to find out which words are the most
used and correlated to each personality type, implementing a
sentiment analysis to classify each type into positive or negative or
neutral sentiments and finally implementing a text classification
with BERT to predict the personality of the subject based on
what he / she posts. This latter classification has proved useful,
showing that is actually possible to detect personality from social
media posts.
